## What the judge pass flags

- Centered-hero + badge + two-button + 3-column-feature-grid is the entire v0 layout grammar, unmodified.
- "Empower your team to do more with less" — zero information; "Blazing Fast / Lightning-quick" — the adjective says fast, the copy says fast, nothing says *how fast at what*.
- "Get Started Today →" — the CTA formula plus arrow.
- Three feature cards with identical shape: icon, two-word title, one vague sentence. Perfect parallelism.

## After (a designed page, sketch)

- Typeface chosen against the product: a grotesque with character (e.g. Söhne, Untitled Sans) or the brand's existing family. Weight contrast does the hierarchy work, not `font-extrabold` everywhere.
- Accent pulled from the product's own UI screenshot, not the Tailwind wheel.
- Hero leads with the product itself — a real screenshot or a 12-second loop — headline states the one measurable claim ("Deploys in 40 seconds; rollbacks in one").
- Feature cards replaced by three short case fragments with real numbers, different lengths, written like a person describing what happened.
- Icons from one system (Lucide or bespoke SVG), or none — text is fine.
- One CTA, verb-first, naming the actual next step: "Connect your repo".
- Light mode unless darkness serves the content. Border radius picked once, on purpose.
