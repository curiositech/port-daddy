"""Regenerate references/*.md from references/catalog.json. Stdlib only.

The catalog is the source of truth; the markdown files are grouped, readable
views of it. Re-run after editing catalog.json.

Two guarantees this script now enforces, because their absence cost real items:

  1. NO ORPHANS. Every catalog item must land in at least one generated file.
     A dialect value of "groq" where the catalog said "grok" silently dropped an
     item out of every reference for months, and nothing noticed because nothing
     checked. This exits non-zero rather than writing a quietly lossy view.

  2. EVERY FIELD IS RENDERED. If you add a field to the catalog, add it here.
     A field that exists only in JSON is a field the model reading the reference
     will never see.

The model has no printer, no Outlook, no German tester, no screen reader, and no second page to navigate to \u2014 so the tell is rarely that it wrote something strange. The tell is that a whole class of output was never looked at, and the defect sat there because looking is the only thing that would have found it.\n\nThat makes this file read UNREVIEWED rather than AI, and the distinction matters when you report a finding: you are telling an author what they have not yet checked, not making a claim about who wrote it. The handful of genuinely model-flavoured entries say so in their own **Why it reads AI** line.\n\nOne structural finding runs through the navigation entries and is worth reading first: `ia-is-a-projection-of-the-filesystem`. The flat nav, the fat footer, the empty mega-menu and the four-deep docs sidebar are four symptoms of one cause \u2014 the information architecture is a rendering of the directory listing, because enumeration is free and prioritisation needs knowledge the generator does not have.\n\nTwo entries here share a fix, which is unusual enough to name: switching a PDF export from `screenshot()` to `page.pdf()` makes the invoice text-selectable AND makes it honour a print stylesheet, so twelve lines of `@media print` repair browser printing and turn a dead raster receipt into a real document at the same time.",

        "intro": "Everything in this file is in the part of accessibility that automation cannot reach. The most generous coverage number any vendor publishes is axe-core's own \u2014 57.38% of issues BY VOLUME, and that figure is high precisely because the things automation catches (missing alt, low contrast, unlabelled fields) are the most numerous. Counted as distinct success criteria a machine can fully verify, coverage is around 30%: roughly 15 of WCAG 2.1 AA's 50.\n\nSo a green automated scan is the START of an accessibility review and never the end. Note the `assistive` detection type, which exists only in this file: about a third of these cannot be settled by a headless browser, because the finding is what a person HEARS. Filing those as `rendered` would invite someone to write an assertion, watch it pass, and launder a manual check into a green tick \u2014 which is the exact failure this whole skill exists to name.\n\n**Most of this reads UNREVIEWED rather than machine-written.** A hand-built 2011 jQuery site fails most of it too, and saying so is part of reporting it honestly. What IS distinctively model-flavoured is a smaller set with one shape: the model produces the APPEARANCE of accessibility work. An `aria-label` on a div. A redundant role on a semantic element. A role promised with no behaviour behind it. A live region that is conditionally rendered and therefore silent. Alt text that describes the photograph instead of doing its job. An accessibility statement asserting a conformance level nobody measured. Those six are the ones to weight, and there is a number behind them: WebAIM's 2026 crawl found home pages WITH ARIA averaging 59.1 errors against 42 for pages without, with more ARIA correlating with more errors. That is not causal, but it is a 17-error penalty attached to exactly the behaviour a model performs when you ask it to make something accessible.\n\nBefore working through this file, do the eleven steps in `references/five-minute-manual-pass.md`. It is written for someone who has never used a screen reader, it finds the majority of what is here, and every step of it passes axe.",

        "intro": "The strings a logged-in user reads mid-task: errors, empty states, button labels, confirmations, notifications, field hints. Their quality bar is not whether they read well \u2014 it is whether they unblock someone who is stuck.\n\n**The mechanism that runs through the whole file, and the reason its findings are legible.** Under uncertainty about what failed, every substantive clause a model could write risks being wrong, and exactly one clause carries zero risk: the one about how sorry everyone is. So the generated string is optimised for the WRITER'S UNCERTAINTY rather than for the READER'S BLOCKAGE \u2014 and the two are anti-correlated. The less the system knows about the failure, the warmer the copy gets. A person who does not know what went wrong writes something terse and slightly embarrassed; a model writes something fluent and kind.\n\n**Why hard string matching is defensible here and nowhere else in this skill.** In prose a closed phrase list is a bad detector: the words have honest uses and the list ages out in months. UI strings are different in kind. A product's user-facing string table is small, enumerable and extractable \u2014 from i18n catalogs, from string literals in the render path, from the error and empty and toast slots in the rendered DOM. Within that surface the phrase space is genuinely narrow, because there are only so many ways to say nothing. \"Something went wrong\" is not a phrase with a good use at a different frequency; it is a phrase with no good use at all in a product that knows what went wrong. So these sets are hard matches rather than frequency cues, and where a set does not close, the item says so and routes to a judge pass.\n\n**One entry is the headline.** `collapsed-empty-states` is not a wording problem and wording cannot repair it: three unrelated situations \u2014 the user has never had data, their filter matched nothing, the fetch failed \u2014 produce the same observable in the component and collapse into one string. It needs a three-way probe, because the defect is a missing branch rather than a present string, and the condition that matters most is the third: an empty list after a failed load is what makes users believe their data was deleted.",

        "intro": "**The governing mechanism, and the thing to say when you report any item here.** A generator emits a stylesheet that is internally consistent and has no craft in it. Craft in typography is almost entirely per-context judgement \u2014 this heading at this size on this measure needs 1.05 leading and slightly negative tracking, and the one three sections down does not. A default is by construction context-free.\n\nSo the tell is never a WRONG VALUE. Any individual number in this file is defensible somewhere. The tell is **one value where there should have been a function of context**, and every static check here is a variant of the same computation: does this property vary with the thing it is supposed to vary with? Leading varies with size and measure, tracking with size, weight with role, contrast with theme, and colour with surface.\n\nThat framing matters for how you say it. You are not telling an author their 1.6 line-height is wrong; you are telling them that a 64px headline and 16px body copy cannot both want it.\n\n**Two cautions that will otherwise generate noise.** Read COMPUTED values, not declaration counts \u2014 utility frameworks bundle a tightening line-height into their size scale, so a page with no explicit `line-height` anywhere is usually correct and flagging it is the error. And restraint is not absence: a deliberately single-weight, single-ratio system is a real tradition and a good one, so the tell is one value PLUS no other axis carrying the hierarchy, never a low count on its own.\n\nThe last section is the cause behind most of the rest. `value-named-tokens-no-semantic-layer` and `semantic-layer-bypassed` are where the colour and scale findings come from: a primitive ramp looks maximally systematic and encodes zero decisions, and a semantic layer that exists but is never used is one of the highest-precision structural tells available \u2014 because a person who bothered to write the token file would have used it.",

So the tells cluster precisely where correctness-in-source and correctness-in-delivery come apart: the `<img>` is valid and the format is wrong; the font stack is tasteful and six weights ship; the component is correct React and it did not need to be React.\n\n**Say UNREVIEWED, not AI-generated, and mean it.** None of this reads \"AI\" the way a triplet fragment does. Three or four entries here are genuinely model-flavoured and say so in their own line; the rest would look identical coming from a person who shipped without watching the page load once. Be especially careful with the population-level claim, because it is the one that will get repeated: the mechanism is well understood and every individual tell in this file is measurable on any given page, but **there is no published measurement that AI-generated sites are heavier**. What exists measures AI-adjacent signals \u2014 builder subdomains, the spread of the indigo palette \u2014 and explicitly does not measure page weight. The blog posts asserting otherwise carry no methodology and recycle a mutated statistic from 2017.\n\n**Before using this file, read `references/performance-budget-and-folklore.md`.** It carries the budget a designer can hold \u2014 eleven numbers you can check in a design review without opening a profiler \u2014 and ten pieces of circulating folklore to drop, including the Lighthouse score, the parse-time constant, the shared font cache and the weight claim above.

It never tells you who wrote it, and it never tells you whether the page is any good.** Three collapses to refuse. Provenance is not authorship: a scaffold dependency in a repo proves where a project STARTED and says nothing about six months of commits since. Provenance is not defect: a CDN host and a server header are infrastructure, and stripping them is either impossible or pointless. And absence proves nothing, because every badge in the table below is removable by paying, so \"no badge\" is never evidence of hand-building. Wix and Squarespace are the sharpest case \u2014 their AI flows now seed the ordinary editor, so AI-built and hand-built output are provably identical in markup, and any finding of the form \"this is AI-generated because it is on Wix\" is simply false.\n\nSo most of this file is NOT findings. `scripts/humanize_review.py --provenance` reports it as a separate mode that writes no report and carries no severity, and that separation is deliberate.\n\n**What earns this file its place is the overlap set**: a handful of cases where the provenance string and a craft problem are the same bytes. An unwritten meta description that reads `Generated by v0`. A share card that is the builder's logo, or an auto-screenshot of a preview build. A favicon that is a build tool's logo. A palette nobody chose, still at the library's exact default oklch values. A generated headshot on an author byline. For those, the fix is never to hide the string \u2014 it is to do the work the string is pointing at, after which the string disappears as a side effect. That is the only removal that is honest, and it is the only advice that survives contact with someone who has to defend the site to their boss.\n\nOne entry in this file is about honesty rather than craft: invented clients, unverifiable testimonials and generated headshots on team pages. Everything else here is a quality judgement where reasonable people differ and \"I used a tool\" is a complete defence. That one is different \u2014 not because you should accuse anyone, but because being specific about what is unverifiable is an edit, and \"an empty Trusted by section is better than a fabricated one\" happens to be true.",

These patterns are statistically NORMAL on the commercial web \u2014 Princeton found 1,818 dark-pattern instances across 1,254 of 11,000 shopping sites \u2014 so they are what \"build me a product page\" or \"add a cookie banner\" retrieves. Treat every item here as a high-confidence finding the author must decide about, never as an inference about intent.\n\nThe surprising part, and the reason this file exists separately: the unlawful thing is usually not the generated component but the GAP between two generated components. `tracking-before-consent` is the clean case \u2014 the analytics snippet is correct, the consent banner is correct, nothing connects them, and the site ends up with a compliant-looking banner sitting on top of a completed violation that no static check of either half would find. `cancellation-has-no-path` and `cost-revealed-at-last-step` have the same shape. So the highest-value checks in this file are RELATIONAL and RENDERED: load the page in a fresh profile and watch the network, rather than grepping either component.\n\nWhich also makes the fairness framing different here from the rest of the catalog.

That single fact predicts most of this file. Duration, easing and stagger are judgements made by watching, so the value that arrives is the corpus median applied uniformly — 300ms for a 2px hover tint and for a full-height sheet alike. And uniform motion is decoration by definition, because decoration is the only use of motion that needs no knowledge of what is actually happening on the page.\n\nThe second half of the file is about input devices. Hover is the state the author sees while building; focus only exists if you put the mouse down, and on a touchscreen hover latches on tap and never releases. None of that is visible in the source, which is why `hover-styles-without-a-hover-guard` and `hover-styled-focus-forgotten` are among the most reliable findings here.\n\nTwo items carry evidence rather than taste. Scroll capture: Nielsen Norman Group's usability testing found most participants at least mildly disoriented, several reading it as a bug rather than a design. And reduced motion: 35.4% of US adults aged 40 and over showed vestibular dysfunction in the 2001-2004 NHANES data, about 69 million people, which is why `prefers-reduced-motion` is not a nicety. Note the specific failure `reduced-motion-honoured-in-css-ignored-in-script` describes — the media query is satisfied while the parallax keeps running, because the query and the animation are two separately correct answers to two separately given instructions.\n\nRead `initial-state-hidden-so-content-depends-on-script` first.

Everything else a generator produces is read; a form is operated — on a phone keyboard, through a password manager, after an error, under time pressure. None of those conditions exist in the markup, so the tells cluster exactly at the properties that only come into being while somebody is using it: the keyboard that opens, the value autofill puts in, what survives a failed submit.\n\n`submit-disabled-until-valid` is the headline and deserves its own paragraph. It is the most reproduced form pattern in generated code, it comes from a clean and testable sentence — \"disable submit until the form is valid\" — and it produces an interface where the control that would tell the user what is wrong is the control being withheld. Practitioners have argued against it for over a decade. Its worst instance is `validity-gate-misses-the-password-manager`: the gate listens for keyup, a password manager's fill does not produce one, and the user is left with a visibly complete form and a dead button having done everything right.\n\nThree items here are WCAG failures in their own right and are not inferences about authorship at all: missing autocomplete tokens (1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose, Level AA), errors not programmatically tied to their fields, and paste blocked on a password field (3.3.8 Accessible Authentication). Act on those with full confidence.\n\nWhere this file gives numbers they come from published research rather than from this catalog: Google reports correct autocomplete cutting checkout time by up to about 30%, and Baymard attributes 18% of checkout abandonment to a long or complicated process against a tracked ~70% overall rate.

        "intro": "A paper's sentences and its checkable commitments come out of the same machinery at the same confidence, and nothing in the finished artifact marks which is which. A generator emits a reference, a sample size, a model version and a reviewer's objection in exactly the register it emits connective prose. So the characteristic failure is not that the writing sounds wrong — it is that the paper's verifiable claims were never verified by anyone, the author included.\n\nThat is why every honest check here points OUTWARD, at the world the manuscript claims to describe: does this DOI resolve to this paper, does the body contain the abstract's number, does this review's objection match anything in the submission. Those checks are about truth rather than authorship. They cost an accused author nothing when they come back clean, and they survive the fact that the population most likely to leave a style marker in a manuscript is the population writing in its second language.\n\n**Two numbers frame the lane.** Topaz and colleagues verified 97.1 million references across about 2.5 million PubMed-indexed papers: the share with at least one fabricated reference went from 1 in 2,828 in 2023 to 1 in 458 in 2025 to 1 in 277 in early 2026, review articles ran 57% higher than other types, and over 98% saw no publisher action. And the human baseline that keeps it honest: 16.9% of quotations in the medical literature already fail to support the sentence they are attached to. Citation checking finds a great deal of ordinary human error, and that is fine, because the fix is the same either way.\n\n**The most actionable item here is a triage rule, not a defect.** `unchecked-tail-of-the-bibliography` rests on a measured gradient: fidelity of model-generated citations correlates with the cited paper's citation count at r = 0.75, saturating near verbatim recall above roughly 1,000 citations. Citation count proxies training-corpus redundancy, so a model recites the famous and synthesises the rest. Sort the bibliography ascending by citation count and verify from the bottom — and note the corollary, that checking the canonical references proves nothing.\n\n**Three things this lane refuses to claim.** A p-value without an effect size is not a tell: 98.06% of 310 papers in Science, Nature and Nature Neuroscience in 2022 gave no confidence intervals. An abstract overstating its results is not one either: measured spin in human-written RCT abstracts runs 49.1% to 85.7% by field. And a fabricated reference does not mean a generated paper — 91% of affected PubMed papers had one or two. The modal case is a researcher who did not check one citation.\n\n**Tortured phrases are in this file and they are not an AI tell.** Cabanac and Labbe's mechanism is word-level machine paraphrasing used to evade text-matching plagiarism detection; instruction-tuned models preserve technical terms. Anyone citing them as proof of ChatGPT use is wrong about the tool and therefore wrong about the remedy.",

The generator commits to `savefig(...)` without ever seeing that the legend landed on the data, that the tick labels are clipped, that 10pt became 2.9pt in an 89mm column, or that the two series print as the same grey. That is why the honest word here is UNREVIEWED rather than AI-generated — and why most of the lane is greppable in the `.py` or `.R` rather than in the pixels.\n\n**Three things get conflated constantly and are kept apart here.** *Image integrity* (duplication, splicing) is a research-integrity matter with its own literature and process, it predates generative models entirely, and the two items covering it say so in capitals. *Generated imagery* is three items. *Unreviewed plotting* is the other twenty-four, and it carries no misconduct implication at all — the data is real and the defaults were never adjusted.\n\n**The arithmetic that makes this structural.** Effective type size is the declared size times the ratio of printed width to figure width. Nature's single column is 89mm (3.50in) and wants 5-7pt; matplotlib's default 10pt in a `figsize=(12,8)` figure lands at 2.92pt. `savefig.dpi` defaults to `'figure'` and `figure.dpi` to 100, so the default figure is written at 640x480 — below PLOS's stated 789px minimum width outright. Neither is visible in the notebook preview.\n\n**The canonical case, with the usual telling corrected.** The Frontiers rat figure was published on 13 February 2024 and retracted on 16 February, three days later; Midjourney was disclosed by the authors. The widely repeated claim that no reviewer looked is wrong. Frontiers stated that one of the reviewers raised valid concerns about the figures and requested revisions, and that the authors failed to respond. The failure was editorial workflow, not reviewer inattention — which changes the fix.\n\n**There is no detector for “is this figure generated” and this file will not pretend otherwise.** Benchmarked against 72,965 real and 150,807 synthetic figures, the best zero-shot method reached 53.68% and most sat at chance, with the characteristic failure being near-100% on real images and 0-3% on synthetic. Cross-generator transfer collapses to 26.1%, and JPEG compression at q=30 takes the best method from 93.96% to 75.94% — and every figure in a PDF has been compressed.\n\n**Four entries elsewhere in this catalog INVERT here** and have been scoped accordingly: journals want vector and reject PNG/JPEG/TIFF for main figures, they want submitted SVG to retain its editing capability rather than be optimised, and a figure's accessible description is its caption, which is required to be long.",

A counter has no value until TeX assigns one, so a generator writes the number it can see.\n\n**Read the family field carefully here.** Ten of these are `defect`: they are reproducible by compiling, so they carry no fairness caveat at all — an undefined macro, a `\\ref` rendering `??`, unbalanced braces, a duplicate BibTeX key, a declaration used as a command.
