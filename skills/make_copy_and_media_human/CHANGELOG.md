# Changelog

<!-- humanize:ignore-start
     A changelog is heading-and-bullet dense by design, which is the documented
     false positive for heading-spam and bullet-colonization (see each item's
     false_positive_when in catalog.json). Marked rather than padded with prose.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-19

Added educational exposition, title-chrome and instructional-media review lanes,
a cross-format title-stack scanner, and validation of explicit reviewer learning
maps. The research note records evidence boundaries and a dated source audit.
Before/after examples now cover learning progression and repeated title layers.

Removed the digit/acronym heuristic for supposedly empty eyebrows. Unicode format
characters now produce a low-severity typography cue without an authorship claim
or blanket deletion advice. Corrected cumulative time in the backoff example and
reduced unsupported style-pattern severity. New fixtures cover structural cues,
legitimate counterexamples and malformed annotation maps.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-14

Rebuilt around measured evidence. The skill previously carried thresholds that
disagreed with its own rubric, and it failed the review it sells: `SKILL.md` ran
3.76 em dashes per 100 words against its own 1.2 threshold, and the examples
flagged the AI-isms they exist to demonstrate. The whole bundle now passes
`--fail-on medium` against itself.

### Added

- `references/fairness-and-false-positives.md`. Why findings are editing cues
  rather than evidence, who gets hurt when they're used as evidence, and the
  tells that do not work. Carries the base-rate argument: because detectors are
  biased toward "human", a flag is more likely to be an unusual person than a
  caught machine.
- `references/fiction-and-narrative-tells.md` and
  `references/engineering-artifact-tells.md`. Story-level tells, and tells for
  commits, PRs, review, code, tests and docs.
- Catalog grew from 70 items to 157. New media: fiction, social-post, email,
  listing, resume, image, video, audio, chart, commit-message, pr-description,
  code-review, code, docs.
- Every item now carries `false_positive_when`, `currency`, `family`, and where
  one exists, `evidence` with a citation. 15 new sources including the PNAS
  grammatical-feature study, the Science Advances excess-vocabulary study, the
  detector-bias literature, and Wikipedia's Signs of AI writing.
- `--baseline` compares rhythm signals against the author's own prior writing.
  `--fail-on` gates CI. `--validate` proves every emitted ism resolves to a
  catalog item.
- New detectors: invisible codepoints, vendor markup residue, chat tracking
  params, unfilled merge-tag placeholders, participial tails, nominalization
  density, copula avoidance, the deontic gap, pronoun evacuation, specificity
  starvation, paragraph-length monoculture, horizontal-rule spam, heading-level
  skips, title-case uniformity, markdown leaking into unrendered media, and a
  code-comment analyzer for narrating comments, swallowed exceptions,
  placeholder stubs and signature-restating docstrings.

### Changed

- Detection is restructured into five families: residue, form, rhythm, shape,
  code. The family, not the severity, says how much to trust a finding.
- Rhythm signals cap at low severity without `--baseline`. Em-dash rate, comma
  rate, contraction rate and sentence variance are fluency proxies that overlap
  badly between people and models; one anti-slop linter measured its em-dash
  rule warning on roughly 64% of legitimate technical blog posts.
- Thresholds moved into `catalog.json` and are read from there, so the rubric
  and the code cannot drift apart again.
- Burstiness now measured as coefficient of variation rather than absolute
  standard deviation, which was scale-dependent and simply wrong.
- Law 1 clarified: no topical keyword lists, with three narrow exceptions for
  machine artifacts, closed grammatical classes measured as rates, and the
  era-versioned excess-vocabulary list.
- Ignore markers now work in the code path, not just the prose path.

### Fixed

- Two catalog entries were wrong and are corrected rather than deleted. The
  mangled-hands image heuristic is marked obsolete and points at provenance
  instead, because current models render hands and text correctly. The
  invisible-codepoint entry is downgraded: U+202F was a real tell for about a
  week in April 2025 before the vendor removed it, and Word, LaTeX and French
  typography all emit it routinely.
- The Inter/indigo entry drops its implied study, because none exists. The
  origin is one designer's public remark, and the entry now says so.
- HTML injection through an unescaped `line` field in the report renderer.
- A `groq` typo that silently dropped the Grok item from every generated
  reference. The generator now fails on any orphaned item.
- An attribution regex containing U+2014 twice and no en dash, so an en-dashed
  byline never counted as attribution.
- Code fences, YAML frontmatter, blockquotes and `<style>` bodies were all
  counted against the author's prose.
- Report CSS shipped 13px text while the skill demanded 14px everywhere.
- A malformed `--findings` file crashed with a raw traceback; zero input files
  produced a report that read as "clean".
- `examples/before-after-landing-page.md` claimed seven structural detections
  where the script makes four, and three of its ism names no longer existed.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-04

Upgraded to the port-daddy agentic-family bundle standard. Frontmatter-only
upgrade — `scripts/humanize_review.py` already is this skill's deterministic
auditor (structural checks + merge point for judge-pass findings), so no
second `.mjs` scorer was added.

- Frontmatter: added `metadata.io-contract` (consumes draft copy/media +
  judge findings; produces humanized copy/media, audit findings, and the
  HTML fix-plan report).
- Frontmatter: replaced dangling `pairs-with` entries (`vibe-matcher`,
  `design-critic`, `seo-content-blogging` — none exist under `skills/` in
  this repo) with verified in-repo skills: `port-daddy-marketing-copy`,
  `port-daddy-expository-writer`, `web-design-expert`.
- Confirmed `metadata.provenance` was already block-style (compliant).
- Added `README.md`, `agents/openai.yaml`, and
  `templates/output-template.md` for bundle completeness; cross-referenced
  both new template/agent files from `SKILL.md`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-12

Initial release. Catalog of 70 AI-isms across 10 model dialects and 10 media,
built by a six-lens research team (Claude prose tropes; GPT/Codex; Gemini,
Kimi, DeepSeek, Qwen, Llama, Grok dialects; visual design; document/deck
structure; published stylometry catalogs — 66 cited sources).

- `skills/make_copy_and_media_human/scripts/humanize_review.py`: structural detector layer + static HTML
  line-item fix-plan renderer, stdlib only, selftested.
- `skills/make_copy_and_media_human/scripts/regenerate_references.py`: references/*.md derive from catalog.json.
- Two-layer detection honors the no-keyword-NLP rule: scripts measure,
  the model judges.
