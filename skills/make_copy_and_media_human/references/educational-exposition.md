# Educational exposition and concept progression

Audit what a reader can do with an idea before later material depends on it. These are pedagogical and editorial checks, not authorship tests. General learning research supports many repairs; evidence specific to AI tutoring is labeled and bounded in education-and-chrome-research.md. Learning-map checks validate reviewer annotations rather than learner mastery.

<a id="definition-without-discrimination"></a>
### `definition-without-discrimination`  ·  high · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

A definition is immediately reused without showing how to distinguish the concept from a plausible near miss.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Can a novice classify one example and one near miss and explain the difference using only the chapter?

**Fix:** Add a contrasting pair at the difficult boundary and explain the distinguishing feature.

**False positive when:** An expert monograph can rely on prerequisite definitions established in an earlier course.

**Evidence:** Editorial application of https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/1. This source supports the mechanism or repair within its studied setting, not AI authorship detection or prevalence of this exact pattern.

<a id="formalism-before-referents"></a>
### `formalism-before-referents`  ·  high · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

An equation arrives before its symbols and quantities have concrete referents for the intended novice.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Ask what each symbol measures and instantiate the expression with one checked set of values.

**Fix:** Name the quantities and relationship, work a concrete case, then connect it to the general expression.

**False positive when:** Expert treatments and deliberate discovery tasks can introduce formalism first with appropriate support.

**Evidence:** Editorial application of https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/1. This source supports the mechanism or repair within its studied setting, not AI authorship detection or prevalence of this exact pattern.

<a id="full-solution-dependency"></a>
### `full-solution-dependency`  ·  high · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

Every exercise exposes its complete solution before the learner has an opportunity to attempt the relevant step.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Compare supported practice with a later unaided problem; do not count assisted completion as learning.

**Fix:** Offer staged hints, completion problems and an independent exit task; preserve access to feedback.

**False positive when:** A solution manual is legitimately answer-rich; it should be identified as that genre.

**Evidence:** Editorial application of https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2422633122. This source supports the mechanism or repair within its studied setting, not AI authorship detection or prevalence of this exact pattern.

<a id="notation-churn-without-mapping"></a>
### `notation-churn-without-mapping`  ·  high · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

The same quantity changes name, symbol, color or units between prose, derivation and figure without a mapping.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Trace one quantity end to end and reproduce the substitutions from the stated definitions.

**Fix:** Choose stable notation or place an explicit conversion beside the transition.

**False positive when:** Comparing conventions is legitimate when the conversion is itself the lesson.

<a id="one-example-overgeneralization"></a>
### `one-example-overgeneralization`  ·  high · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

One favorable worked case is presented as if it establishes an unrestricted rule.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Test a boundary case or a case violating an assumption; does the stated rule survive?

**Fix:** State the domain and assumptions, show a near miss, and distinguish illustration from proof.

**False positive when:** A theorem already proved may use a single example simply to illustrate its application.

**Evidence:** Editorial application of https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/1. This source supports the mechanism or repair within its studied setting, not AI authorship detection or prevalence of this exact pattern.

<a id="scaffolding-difficulty-cliff"></a>
### `scaffolding-difficulty-cliff`  ·  high · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

The lesson jumps from a complete solution to an independent problem requiring several untaught decisions.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Compare the last supported task and first independent task: list newly required operations.

**Fix:** Insert a completion problem or a smaller challenge, then fade support as performance permits.

**False positive when:** A diagnostic challenge may intentionally reveal missing prerequisites before teaching begins.

<a id="source-exists-claim-does-not"></a>
### `source-exists-claim-does-not`  ·  high · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

A real citation is treated as verification even though its design, population or result does not support the attached claim.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Check existence, sentence alignment, method and transfer scope separately.

**Fix:** Cite the precise supporting result, narrow the claim, or remove it; record unresolved evidence.

**False positive when:** A citation may legitimately be background or a counterposition when its role is stated.

**Evidence:** Editorial application of https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-41032-5. This source supports the mechanism or repair within its studied setting, not AI authorship detection or prevalence of this exact pattern.

### `toy-example-promoted-to-evidence`  ·  high · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

An invented teaching dataset or illustrative simulation is presented as an empirical research finding.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Trace every number to observed data, a reproducible model or an explicitly synthetic example.

**Fix:** Label teaching data as synthetic and separate the demonstration from empirical evidence.

**False positive when:** Synthetic data are valid for a declared simulation or conceptual demonstration.

<a id="worked-example-hides-decision"></a>
### `worked-example-hides-decision`  ·  high · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

A worked example shows inputs and answer while concealing the step the learner is supposed to acquire.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Locate the most difficult choice; does the explanation say why that operation is valid rather than merely announce its result?

**Fix:** Show that step with values, assumptions, units and a reason; check the calculation independently.

**False positive when:** Routine arithmetic can be omitted when it is already an explicit prerequisite.

<a id="analogy-without-boundary"></a>
### `analogy-without-boundary`  ·  medium · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

An analogy introduces a concept but its limitations are never stated before the learner reasons from it.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Name one inference that works in the analogy and fails in the target system; check whether the text blocks it.

**Fix:** Map the relevant relation and explicitly retire the analogy where it stops matching.

**False positive when:** A brief motivational comparison need not teach a complete model when no subsequent inference depends on it.

<a id="example-carousel-no-invariant"></a>
### `example-carousel-no-invariant`  ·  medium · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

Several examples change story, notation and representation without naming what remains structurally the same.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Ask the learner to map corresponding quantities across examples; identify whether the text supplies the mapping.

**Fix:** Keep a running example until the invariant is clear, then vary one dimension and make the mapping explicit.

**False positive when:** A comparison exercise may intentionally withhold the invariant until the learner proposes it.

<a id="expertise-insensitive-scaffolding"></a>
### `expertise-insensitive-scaffolding`  ·  medium · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

Novices and experts receive identical explanation depth, or redundant novice narration obscures the new result.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Identify what this audience already knows and which two decisions are genuinely new.

**Fix:** State prerequisites and offer a short route for prepared readers while preserving support for novices.

**False positive when:** A mixed-audience reference may deliberately offer optional detailed derivations.

<a id="feedback-without-error-model"></a>
### `feedback-without-error-model`  ·  medium · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

Feedback gives a verdict and the correct answer without locating the misconception that produced the error.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** For one plausible wrong response, does feedback explain why it fails and invite repair?

**Fix:** Identify the mistaken assumption or operation and offer a targeted next attempt.

**False positive when:** Simple factual recall can need only corrective feedback rather than a long diagnosis.

<a id="recognition-masquerades-as-retrieval"></a>
### `recognition-masquerades-as-retrieval`  ·  medium · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

A recap or an answer-visible quiz is treated as evidence the reader can reconstruct the idea.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Hide the explanation and answer: what must the learner produce rather than recognize?

**Fix:** Ask for a short unaided reconstruction, then reveal explanatory feedback and revisit later.

**False positive when:** Recognition can be the target skill, and accessible support may be intentionally available.

<a id="seductive-detail-detour"></a>
### `seductive-detail-detour`  ·  medium · generic-llm · education · llm-judge · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

A striking story, analogy or image interrupts the hardest conceptual step without helping explain it.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Remove the detail and attempt the target task; determine whether any necessary relation disappears.

**Fix:** Move optional context after the model or replace it with an example that carries the needed relation.

**False positive when:** Motivation, history or narrative can be the learning objective rather than decoration.

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

The reviewer map contains no located worked example, independent practice, or retrieval opportunity for a target concept.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Check reviewer-supplied evidence locations; an absent annotation is a review gap, not proof the chapter lacks an exercise.

**Fix:** Locate the existing learning activity or add a task aligned to the intended skill.

**False positive when:** Conceptual overviews and reference entries may route readers to exercises elsewhere.

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

A later concept depends on knowledge neither declared as prior knowledge nor established earlier in the annotated lesson.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Check explicit learning-map dependencies and first-use order; the script validates annotations, not comprehension.

**Fix:** Teach the prerequisite, move the dependent step, or state and link the assumed knowledge.

**False positive when:** Expert references may declare prior knowledge and legitimately omit its introduction.

**Evidence:** Editorial application of https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/1. This source supports the mechanism or repair within its studied setting, not AI authorship detection or prevalence of this exact pattern.

<a id="transfer-evidence-missing"></a>
### `transfer-evidence-missing`  ·  low · generic-llm · education · structural · family: shape · lane: educational-exposition

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

A lesson claims reusable understanding but its annotated evidence includes no changed-case task.

**Why it reads AI:** Review hypothesis about unexamined assembly or task mismatch. This pattern can occur in human work and does not establish authorship.

**Detect:** Inspect the supplied learning map, then judge whether the claimed transfer task actually changes relevant conditions.

**Fix:** Add or link an unaided problem with changed representation or context and a reasoned solution.

**False positive when:** A first orientation or reference sheet may explicitly make no transfer claim.
