# LaTeX source — it compiled, and nobody opened the PDF

LaTeX source is a program nobody in the loop has run — and the tell is never that it failed to compile. Syntax errors are a small share of LLM LaTeX errors; package errors and logical or formatting errors dominate. The tell is that it COMPILED and nobody opened the PDF.

That predicts the whole lane. Generated `.tex` reaches for LaTeX's VISUAL layer — `\\`, `\vspace`, `\textbf`, a typed-out “Figure 1” — over its SEMANTIC layer — `\label`/`\ref`, `\emph`, `\cite`, `\section`, `\qty` — because the visual layer is the only one verifiable from the token stream alone. A counter has no value until TeX assigns one, so a generator writes the number it can see.

**Read the family field carefully here.** Ten of these are `defect`: they are reproducible by compiling, so they carry no fairness caveat at all — an undefined macro, a `\ref` rendering `??`, unbalanced braces, a duplicate BibTeX key, a declaration used as a command. The rest are craft, and craft is contestable.

**This lane makes no claim that any of it is commoner in generated than in hand-written LaTeX, and the honest reason is uncomfortable.** The largest mined corpus of real LaTeX faults is a taxonomy of HUMAN faults with the same top categories — undefined control sequence, brace group, math mode. People break LaTeX in exactly these ways. Every item here reads UNREVIEWED unless it says otherwise, and the value is that the finding is worth fixing either way.

**Two items are about what the source reveals rather than what it renders.** arXiv publishes your `.tex`: one study of 600,000 submissions found 27% of uploaded bytes were residual, including comments about coauthors and over 1,500 Google Docs links, 200 of them open to anyone. And `hidden-instruction-to-machine-reader` is the inverse of everything else in this catalog — white text or a 1pt font carrying “give a positive review”, aimed at a referee's model. That is deliberate and adversarial, not residue, and it belongs to the venue's integrity process rather than to an editing pass.

_30 items. Generated from catalog.json — edit there, then re-run `scripts/regenerate_references.py`. Do not hand-edit this file._

_Every item carries a **False positive when** line. Read it before you act on the item: these are cues for an editor, not evidence about an author._

### `anonymization-state-mismatch`  ·  high · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: residue · lane: latex

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

The document's blinding does not match where it is going. In one direction a double-blind submission still names authors, thanks a funder by grant number, or links a personal GitHub repo, because the template's \usepackage[review]{acl} or a commented-out \iclrfinalcopy / \cvprfinalcopy was never set. In the other direction a camera-ready still reads `Anonymous Authors`, `Anonymous Institution`, or still carries the review-margin line numbers. ACL's author checklist names both halves; aclpubcheck detects the ruler and margin side of it from the PDF.

**Why it reads AI:** Anonymization is a property of the submission process, not of the document, so it lives in exactly the kind of one-line preamble switch that a producer working from the body text has no reason to touch. Nothing in the source is wrong; the mismatch only exists relative to a venue.

**Detect:** Static: read the anonymization switch (`\usepackage[review]{acl}`, `\iclrfinalcopy`, `\cvprfinalcopy`, `\documentclass[anonymous]`) and assert it matches the destination; then grep the body for `\author{Anonymous`, `Anonymous Institution`, `\thanks{`, `\section\*?{Acknowledg`, `github\.com/`, `orcid\.org`, and grant-number patterns. A commented-out switch (`% \iclrfinalcopy`) next to a real author block is the high-confidence form.

**Fix:** Decide which state the file is in and make every switch agree. Keep the deanonymized front matter in a separate \input file so flipping state is one line rather than a hunt.

**False positive when:** Single-blind and open-review venues (most IEEE conferences, arXiv itself) want the real names, the acknowledgements and the repository link. Check the venue's rules before treating a real name as a leak, and never flag an acknowledgements section without knowing which state the paper is in.

### `command-without-its-package`  ·  high · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: defect · lane: latex

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

A command used whose package is never loaded: \includegraphics with no graphicx, \toprule with no booktabs, \qty/\SI with no siunitx, \Cref with no cleveref, \multirow with no multirow, \text{} inside math with no amsmath. The LaTeX generation benchmark names this exact case ('Using \includegraphics without importing the graphicx package') as its worked example of a package error.

**Why it reads AI:** A generator writes the body it was asked for and the preamble it half-remembers, and there is no step that reconciles them, because reconciling them requires running the document. A person who compiled once gets a loud error and fixes it in ten seconds.

**Detect:** Static: a fixed command-to-package map checked against the preamble, greppable both ways. About a dozen pairs cover most of it -- graphicx/includegraphics, booktabs/toprule|midrule|bottomrule|cmidrule, siunitx/qty|SI|num|si, cleveref/cref|Cref, multirow/multirow, amsmath/align|text|DeclareMathOperator|split, algorithmicx/State|Procedure, xcolor/textcolor|definecolor, subcaption/subfigure|subcaptionbox, hyperref/href|hypersetup, listings/lstlisting, tikz/tikzpicture. Compare `grep -c '\\toprule' *.tex` against `grep -c 'usepackage.*booktabs' *.tex` and so on.

**Fix:** Add the \usepackage line -- then check load order, because hyperref and cleveref have a documented position.

**False positive when:** Publisher classes load packages for you -- acmart loads booktabs and graphicx, revtex loads graphicx -- and adding the line again can trigger `Option clash for package`. Read the .cls before adding anything.

### `comment-residue-in-public-source`  ·  high · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: residue · lane: latex

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

Percent comments, \todo{} notes, commented-out alternative sentences and dead \iffalse...\fi blocks shipped with the source. This matters far more than it looks, because arXiv publishes the .tex you upload -- anyone can click 'TeX Source'. A longitudinal study of roughly 600,000 arXiv submissions from 2015-2025 found 27% of uploaded bytes were not needed to produce the PDF, rising from about 14% in 2015-2017 to 32% in 2022, and its qualitative pass found offensive language about coauthors and reviewers, over 1,500 Google Docs links (at least 200 open to anyone with the link), and notes suggesting the authors avoid mentioning limitations.

**Why it reads AI:** Two distinct sources feed this. Drafting residue is human and old. The newer half is a producer that keeps the alternative it rejected, because commenting out is cheaper than deleting when nothing costs tokens -- and the commented-out alternative sentence is the one that reads as a machine keeping both branches.

**Detect:** Static: grep the tree for `\\todo|\\TODO|FIXME|XXX|\\marginpar|\\note{`, for `\\begin{comment}` and `\\iffalse`, and for `docs\.google\.com|drive\.google\.com|dropbox\.com|slack\.com|overleaf\.com/`. Then count `%`-initiated lines whose content is prose rather than structure, and list every file in the upload that no \input / \includegraphics chain reaches. ACL's checklist puts it plainly: 'no comments or any leftover meta-text from prior revisions'.

**Fix:** Run arxiv_latex_cleaner before uploading: it strips comments, \begin{comment} and \iffalse blocks, named commands via --commands_to_delete, and unreferenced .tex and image files. Then read what it left. Delete text you cut instead of commenting it out; version control already remembers.

**False positive when:** Comments are good practice while writing -- a fold marker, the source of a number, why a \vspace exists. The finding is comments reaching a public archive, not comments existing. Theses, textbooks and repositories meant to be read as source are the exception, and so is a paper whose reproducibility package is the source.

### `conference-template-residue`  ·  high · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: residue · lane: latex

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

A publisher or conference template's own placeholder text still in the file. The literal set is small, closed and famous. From ACM acmart: `Conference acronym 'XX`, `Make sure to enter the correct conference title from your rights confirmation email`, `June 03--05, 2018`, `Woodstock, NY`, `978-1-4503-XXXX-X`, `The Name of the Title is Hope`, `Trovato`. From the NeurIPS template: `David S.~Hippocampus`. From the IEEE conference template: `Given Name Surname`, `dept. name of organization`, `email address or ORCID`, `Paper Title (use style: paper title)`. These reach arXiv and published proceedings regularly.

**Why it reads AI:** A template is a fill-in-the-blanks document and a generator is a fill-in-the-blanks machine, so the fields it was not given are left exactly as the template shipped them. It is also a legitimately human failure mode -- which is why the value here is the grep list, not the inference.

**Detect:** Static: literal grep against that closed list, plus the structural forms `\acmConference\[Conference acronym`, `\acmDOI{XXXXXXX`, `10.1145/nnnnnnn`, `\acmISBN{978-1-4503-XXXX-X`. Essentially zero false positives outside a document about templates, which makes this proof rather than inference and a good first check on any submission.

**Fix:** Fill in every field the template asked for, or delete the line. For a preprint, remove the \acmConference and \acmISBN block entirely rather than leaving 2018 Woodstock in it.

**False positive when:** Template repositories, teaching materials, style-file test documents and this catalog itself carry the literals as their subject matter. Scope the grep to a document actually being submitted.

### `font-declaration-used-as-command`  ·  high · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: defect · lane: latex

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

\bfseries{word}, \itshape{word}, \large{sentence}, \sffamily{label} -- a declaration written as if it took an argument. Declarations take no argument and stay in force to the end of the enclosing group, so the braces do nothing and everything after the point of use is bold, italic or large. The classic symptom on TeX.SE is 'why is my entire dissertation bold', and it is listed among the most common LaTeX mistakes people are asked to fix.

**Why it reads AI:** Every other markup language the model knows wraps: <b>x</b>, **x**, \textbf{x}. LaTeX's declaration/command split has no analogue elsewhere, so the wrapping form is generated by analogy and the page is what tells you it was wrong.

**Detect:** Static: a single regex with no false-positive class. `grep -nE '\\(bfseries|itshape|slshape|scshape|upshape|mdseries|rmfamily|sffamily|ttfamily|tiny|scriptsize|footnotesize|small|normalsize|large|Large|LARGE|huge|Huge|bf|it|rm|sc|sl|tt|em)\{' *.tex`. A brace group opening immediately after a declaration name is always a misunderstanding.

**Fix:** Use the argument-taking form (\textbf{}, \textit{}), or scope the declaration with an explicit group.

**False positive when:** Not a fairness question -- it renders wrong. The one lookalike is correct scoping with the brace BEFORE the command, `{\bfseries ...}`, and a macro body like \newcommand{\head}[1]{\bfseries #1}. Match only a brace that immediately follows the command name.

**Before**

> \bfseries{Important:} the rest of this chapter is not meant to be bold.

### `hardcoded-cross-reference-number`  ·  high · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: form · lane: latex

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

'Figure 1', 'Section 3.2', 'Table 4' or 'Equation (7)' typed as literal digits instead of \ref. It is right on the day it is written and wrong the first time anything is inserted above it, and nothing warns, because from LaTeX's side it is just text. This is the purest instance of the lane's mechanism: a producer writes the number it can see in its own token stream, because it has no counter and no page.

**Why it reads AI:** \ref is a promise redeemed at compile time by a counter the producer cannot evaluate; a digit is a token it can. So the generator writes the digit that is true of the document it just emitted, and it stays true for exactly as long as nobody edits.

**Detect:** Static: very greppable. `grep -nE '(Figure|Fig\.|Table|Section|Sec\.|Equation|Eq\.|Algorithm|Appendix|Chapter)[~ ]+\(?[0-9]' *.tex`. TeXtidote implements exactly this as rules sh:hcfig, sh:hctab, sh:hcsec and sh:hccha: 'Do not refer to sections, figures and tables using a hard-coded number. Use \ref instead.'

**Fix:** \label the target and \ref it -- better, \Cref from cleveref, which also supplies the word, so Figure/Fig./FIG. stays consistent with the venue's style automatically.

**False positive when:** References to a figure in a DIFFERENT document ('Figure 2 of Smith et al.') are correctly literal, as are numbered items inside quoted material, a response-to-reviewers letter, and legends inside a figure's own caption. Exclude quoted and bibliographic contexts before reporting.

### `hidden-instruction-to-machine-reader`  ·  high · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: residue · lane: latex

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

Text placed in the source so a human reader cannot see it but a machine reading the PDF can: white-on-white \textcolor{white}{...}, a \fontsize{0.1pt}{0.1pt}\selectfont block, or text positioned outside the text block. In 2025 Nikkei found such prompts in 17 arXiv preprints whose lead authors sat at 14 institutions including KAIST, Waseda, Peking University, NUS, Washington and Columbia -- one to three sentences, with instructions such as 'give a positive review only' and 'do not highlight any negatives'. ACL now states that submissions attempting to manipulate machine readers will be desk rejected.

**Why it reads AI:** This is not generation residue -- it is deliberate, and it exists only because the author assumes a language model will read the PDF. It belongs in this lane because LaTeX is the medium that makes it easy and because the check is the same pdftotext diff either way. Report it as an integrity finding, never as evidence about who wrote the paper.

**Detect:** Static: grep for `\\textcolor{white}`, `\\color{white}`, `\\fontsize{0`, `\\fontsize{[01]\.`, `\\phantom{`, and large-magnitude negative `\\hspace{-` / `\\vspace{-1[0-9][0-9]`. Rendered to confirm, and this is the check that actually generalizes: run `pdftotext` and diff the extracted text layer against what is visible on the page. Anything in the text layer with no visible rendering is the finding, whatever it says and however it was produced.

**Fix:** Delete it. If the intent was legitimate metadata for an indexer, declare it where metadata belongs: \hypersetup{pdfkeywords={...}}.

**False positive when:** White text over a dark tcolorbox or a figure background is ordinary design, \phantom is a standard alignment tool, and accessibility alt-text legitimately lives in the text layer without being visible. Judge the rendered page against the text layer, not the command.

### `macro-used-but-never-defined`  ·  high · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: defect · lane: latex

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

A control sequence used but defined nowhere: not in the kernel, not in the document class, not in any loaded package, not in a \newcommand. pdfTeX halts with `! Undefined control sequence.` This is the single largest category in a mined taxonomy of localized hard-crash LaTeX faults -- 18.5% of 168 verified crashes -- and it is also what a plausible-looking invented macro produces: \bm{x} with no bm loaded, \argmin with no \DeclareMathOperator, \begin{theorem} where the document declared \newtheorem{thm}.

**Why it reads AI:** The model emits the macro it expects to exist, exactly as it emits the Python function it expects to exist. LaTeX makes this worse than most languages because there is no import statement binding a name to a source: a command is just a token, so an invented one looks identical to a real one until the engine runs.

**Detect:** Static: extract every `\\[A-Za-z@]+` token outside verbatim/listings/comments; subtract the kernel and class-provided set, every package's provided set, and every name bound by \newcommand|\renewcommand|\providecommand|\DeclareMathOperator|\def|\let|\newenvironment|\newtheorem. The remainder is the candidate set. Rendered to confirm: `grep -n 'Undefined control sequence' main.log` -- the log names the file and line, and a non-empty result is a build break, not an opinion.

**Fix:** Define the macro, load the package that provides it, or fix the spelling. `texdoc <package>` gives the real name.

**False positive when:** Not a fairness question -- this does not build. The real technical exception: a macro provided by a class file the checker cannot see (a publisher .cls sitting beside the source), and definitions guarded by \@ifpackageloaded or \ifdefined. Run the check with the actual class on the path before reporting.

### `manual-linebreak-as-paragraph`  ·  high · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: form · lane: latex

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

\\ used to end paragraphs or to manufacture vertical space, instead of a blank line. \\ means 'break this line and stay in the same paragraph', so the result is a paragraph with a ragged short line, no indentation on what follows, and no paragraph spacing -- and the document loses the ability to reflow when the class or column width changes. The top-voted list of common LaTeX mistakes on TeX.SE opens with exactly this: 'Ending each and every paragraph in the document with \\ (or even \\[10pt]) instead of a blank line.'

**Why it reads AI:** A blank line is invisible structure; \\ is a visible instruction. A producer optimizing a token stream reaches for the token that makes the break explicit, because that is the one it can see it emitted. The same instinct produced <br> in generated HTML.

**Detect:** Static: `grep -nE '\\\\[[:space:]]*$' *.tex` and flag every occurrence not inside tabular|array|align|eqnarray|matrix|cases|tabbing|verse|\author|\title|\IEEEauthorblock|\address. Count `\\\\\\\\\[[0-9.]+(pt|em|ex|cm)\]` separately -- that is the same tell plus manual vertical space, so it is the higher-confidence form. TeXtidote ships this as rule sh:nobreak.

**Fix:** Blank line between paragraphs. If you want more space between paragraphs, set it once with \usepackage{parskip} or one \setlength{\parskip}{...}, not per paragraph.

**False positive when:** Inside tables, aligned math, verse, addresses, title blocks and author blocks, \\ is the correct row separator and there is no alternative. Slide classes (beamer) and letter classes use it routinely in body text. The tell is \\ in running prose.

### `missing-or-absolute-path-include`  ·  high · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: defect · lane: latex

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

\input, \include, \includegraphics, \addbibresource or \bibliography pointing at a file that is not in the project: a chapter never written, a figure never exported, or an absolute local path like /Users/alex/Desktop/plot.pdf or C:/thesis/fig.png that exists on exactly one machine. Graphics-include faults were 7.1% of one mined crash taxonomy, with missing-external-file a separate category beside it.

**Why it reads AI:** The generator writes the document it would have built, including the files it would have made. Nothing in the loop touches a filesystem, so a path is just a string that looks like a path. The absolute-path variant is the opposite failure and just as diagnostic: it is a real path from one machine, pasted.

**Detect:** Static: extract the argument of \input|\include|\includegraphics|\addbibresource|\bibliography|\lstinputlisting|\subfile and stat each path against the source tree, trying the usual graphics extension list. Separately, flag any argument matching `^(/|[A-Za-z]:[\\/]|~/)` -- TeXtidote ships exactly this as rule sh:relpath, 'Figures should not refer to hard-coded local paths.'

**Fix:** Put figures in a figures/ subdirectory beside the source and reference them relatively. If the input does not exist yet, delete the line rather than shipping a build that only works for you.

**False positive when:** \graphicspath or a TEXINPUTS entry can make a bare name resolve from elsewhere, and builds that generate figures (a Makefile rule, pgfplots externalization, a notebook export step) legitimately reference files that do not exist until the build runs. Check for a build step before reporting.

### `negative-vspace-to-hit-page-limit`  ·  high · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: form · lane: latex

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

A cluster of negative vertical space around section headings, floats and the bibliography: \vspace{-0.5cm}, \vspace*{-1em}, \setlength{\textfloatsep}{0pt}, \addtolength{\abovedisplayskip}{-3pt}, \small wrapped around the whole reference list. Individually each is legal. As a pattern in a paper sitting exactly at the page limit it is a squeeze, and venues treat spacing that deviates from the style file as a formatting violation -- ACL's checklist requires the template's standard vertical spacing for figures, tables and title, and aclpubcheck measures the margins from the produced PDF.

**Why it reads AI:** Not a generation tell by itself -- humans have done this since page limits existed. It belongs here because it is the archetype of the lane's mechanism running in reverse: a visual fix applied to a symptom that lives on a page, by someone who has looked at the page and decided to lie to it rather than cut text.

**Detect:** Static: count `\\vspace\*?\{-`, `\\vskip[[:space:]]*-`, `\\addtolength\{\\(above|below)[a-z]*skip\}\{-`, `\\setlength\{\\(textfloatsep|intextsep|abovecaptionskip|belowcaptionskip|abovedisplayskip|floatsep)\}\{-?0(\.[0-9]+)?(pt|em)?\}`, and `\\renewcommand\{\\baselinestretch\}\{0\.`. Three or more in one document, or any of them in the preamble of a venue whose style file forbids it, is the finding. Rendered to confirm: run aclpubcheck, or measure the PDF's margins against the class defaults.

**Fix:** Cut text. If you genuinely need space, use the venue's own mechanisms: a Limitations or appendix section that does not count toward the limit, \small on one table, enumitem options on one list.

**False positive when:** A single \vspace{-\baselineskip} to fix one bad break before a float is ordinary craft, and many publisher classes leave a genuinely ugly gap authors are expected to close. Some venues explicitly permit spacing adjustment. The tell is the pattern joined with the page count -- check whether the paper is at the limit before believing it.

### `unbalanced-braces-or-environments`  ·  high · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: defect · lane: latex

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

\begin{X} closed by \end{Y}, an environment opened and never closed, or a brace group that never closes -- the class of fault where the engine's error points hundreds of lines past the real problem. In a mined taxonomy of hard-crash LaTeX faults, brace-group faults and math-mode faults were 8.9% each; environment mismatch and undefined environment are separate categories on top of that.

**Why it reads AI:** Long generated blocks -- a nested tabular, a multi-row align, a tikzpicture -- are where a token-by-token producer loses track of depth, and nothing in the loop counts the stack. It is the LaTeX version of a truncated JSON object.

**Detect:** Static: a stack walk over \begin{...}/\end{...} and over { / } outside verbatim and comments. ChkTeX reports these as warnings 9 (`\end{X} expected but found \end{Y}`), 10 (`\end` with no `\begin`), 15 (no matching \end), 16 (math mode still on at end of file) and 17 (brace count mismatch). `chktex -w9 -w10 -w15 -w16 -w17 main.tex` is a two-second CI gate and needs no judgment at all.

**Fix:** Run chktex or lacheck before you run LaTeX. Both localize the fault far better than the engine.

**False positive when:** Not a fairness question; it is a build break. One lookalike: macros that split an environment across definitions (\newcommand{\startbox}{\begin{tcolorbox}}) confuse a naive stack walk. Whitelist those macros rather than turning the check off.

### `usepackage-that-does-not-exist`  ·  high · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: defect · lane: latex

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

\usepackage{...} naming a package that is not in any TeX distribution and not on CTAN -- the LaTeX form of a hallucinated import. Plausible names are exactly what a generator is good at: \usepackage{tablenotes}, \usepackage{mathsymbols}, \usepackage{algorithmic2e} all read as reasonably as \usepackage{amsmath} until something tries to load them. A benchmark of LaTeX generation across nine models found package errors were 15.2-29.9% of all errors and its authors note that non-standard package use 'may point to LLMs hallucinating or making up packages to fill reasoning gaps'.

**Why it reads AI:** Same mechanism as slopsquatting in package managers, with one aggravating difference: there is no lockfile, no manifest and no resolver step in a LaTeX project, so nothing in the ordinary workflow ever asks whether a package name is real until the document is built.

**Detect:** Static: fully mechanical. For every argument of `\usepackage[opts]{a,b,c}` and `\documentclass{...}`, run `kpsewhich <name>.sty` (or `.cls`) against a full TeX Live. Anything that does not resolve is the finding. Secondary network check: `curl -s https://ctan.org/json/2.0/pkg/<name>` returns `{"errors":["Not found"]}` for a name CTAN does not know. Use CTAN only as a second opinion, because many .sty files live inside a differently named bundle -- `algpseudocode.sty` ships in `algorithmicx` and returns Not found from that API while being entirely real. kpsewhich is the authority; CTAN is the tiebreak.

**Fix:** Resolve the name with kpsewhich or texdoc. If the capability is real but the package is not, find the one that actually provides it, and pin the discovery in a preamble comment so the next person does not re-search.

**False positive when:** Packages installed in a local texmf tree, a .sty shipped beside the source, and packages newer than the checking distribution all resolve on the author's machine and not on yours. Look for a sibling .sty file before calling a name invented.

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

**Currency:** Fading — still seen, but vendors have patched toward it and it is weakening.

Punctuation that came from a chat window or a word processor rather than from TeX. The clearest case is the straight double quote: TeX renders `"` as a closing quote on both sides, so "the result" prints with two right-hand quotes. Also a single hyphen where an en dash (--) or em dash (---) belongs, pasted U+201C / U+201D / U+2018 / U+2019 / U+2014, and U+00A0 or U+202F where a tie (~) or thin space (\,) was meant.

**Why it reads AI:** It says the text passed through a window that does typographic substitution, which includes a chat interface and also includes Word, Google Docs, a Slack message and a web page. It is a provenance hint about the clipboard, not about the author -- and in a .tex file it is worth fixing regardless because the straight quote genuinely renders wrong.

**Detect:** Static: `chktex -w18 -w8 -w34 main.tex` is the whole check -- warning 18 is 'Use either `` or '' as an alternative to "', warning 8 is 'Wrong length of dash may have been used', warning 34 is 'Don't mix quotes'. Add a codepoint scan for the smart-quote, dash and invisible-space ranges outside verbatim, listings, minted and \url arguments.

**Fix:** Use `` and '' , or \enquote{} from csquotes, which picks the right marks for the language and nests correctly. Use -- for numeric ranges and --- for parenthetical dashes.

**False positive when:** Modern LaTeX has accepted UTF-8 by default since 2018, so pasted curly quotes and em dashes now typeset correctly; this stopped being a build break years ago and is a consistency finding. verbatim, listings, minted, \url and .bib URL fields all need literal straight quotes. And a hit means 'this was pasted', which is not the same as 'a model wrote it'.

### `duplicate-bibtex-key`  ·  medium · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: defect · lane: latex

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

The same citation key defined twice, usually because two .bib files were concatenated or an entry was pasted twice from different digital libraries with slightly different fields. BibTeX treats this as fatal -- `Repeated entry---line N of file refs.bib` -- and skips the rest of that entry. Biber warns and keeps one arbitrarily, so the bibliography quietly prints whichever version won, which may be the one without the DOI.

**Why it reads AI:** Bibliographies are assembled by concatenation, and a generator concatenating two sources has no reason to reconcile them. The near-duplicate case is worse and more characteristic, because a key invented from author and year will collide semantically without colliding literally.

**Detect:** Static: `grep -ho '^@[a-zA-Z]*{[^,]*,' *.bib | sed 's/.*{//;s/,//' | sort | uniq -d`. Then the harder and more useful second pass: normalize every `title` field (lowercase, strip punctuation and braces) and flag distinct keys that collide -- that is the same paper cited twice under two names, which key-uniqueness checking cannot see and which prints as two entries in the reference list.

**Fix:** Merge the entries, keeping the one with the DOI. Adopt a derivable key scheme (author initials plus year) so duplicates collide by construction instead of coexisting.

**False positive when:** Not a fairness question. Legitimate: bibtopic and multibib workflows that deliberately keep per-chapter .bib files with overlapping entries, and biblatex with several \addbibresource files where last-wins is understood and accepted.

### `every-float-pinned-here`  ·  medium · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: form · lane: latex

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

[H] or [h!] on every figure and table, usually with \usepackage{float} added for the purpose. [H] means 'here and only here', which disables the float mechanism entirely, so LaTeX can no longer move the object to avoid a bad break and you get half-empty pages -- and in a two-column class, objects that cannot fit their column at all. [h] alone gives LaTeX exactly one option, and when it fails the object lands on the next page anyway, which is the outcome the author was trying to prevent.

**Why it reads AI:** Floating is a property of the page, and a producer with no page has no model of it. [H] is the option that makes the output match the source order, which is the only order it can see, so it is the option that gets generated by default.

**Detect:** Static: `grep -cE 'begin\{(figure|table)\*?\}\[(H|h!?|!h)\]' *.tex` against the total float count. A ratio near 1.0 is the finding; one or two pinned floats is normal craft. Also flag `\usepackage{float}` in a document with no [H] -- and the reverse, [H] with no float package, which is the `LaTeX Error: Unknown float option 'H'` build break.

**Fix:** [tbp] as the default. Declare the float BEFORE the paragraph that discusses it. Use [H] only where position carries meaning -- a figure inside a numbered exercise, a screenshot in a step-by-step procedure.

**False positive when:** Entirely legitimate where position carries meaning: tutorials, lab manuals, problem sets, slide decks, and any document where the figure is a step in a procedure. Some publisher classes ask for [H]. The tell is [H] everywhere in a paper, not [H] anywhere.

### `float-migrated-far-from-its-text`  ·  medium · generic-llm · latex-source · rendered · family: defect · lane: latex

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

A figure or table that prints pages away from the sentence discussing it -- 'as Figure 3 shows' on page 4, Figure 3 on page 9. Nothing in the source records this. It is a consequence of float placement rules interacting with how much material is in the queue, and it is a real reading defect: the reader has to hold a claim in their head across pages.

**Why it reads AI:** Float placement is a global optimization the engine performs over the whole document. It is not represented anywhere in the token stream, so it cannot be anticipated, only observed. It is also the defect that makes a PDF read as unopened more reliably than any word choice.

**Detect:** Rendered to confirm: compile, then compare the page of each \ref against the page of its target. A short script over the .aux plus \pageref does it, and the refcheck package reports it directly. Static proxy: count floats declared between two \clearpage boundaries -- a queue longer than about three in a two-column class will migrate -- and flag floats declared AFTER the paragraph that references them, which guarantees the float cannot appear before its discussion.

**Fix:** Give each float a real placement list ([tbp], not [h]), declare it in the source BEFORE the paragraph that references it, and use \usepackage[section]{placeins} in a document with many floats so nothing crosses a section boundary.

**False positive when:** Not a fairness question. Legitimate: journals that reflow every float during production and tell authors not to fight placement, and appendices where a block of figures at the end is the intended layout.

### `float-never-referenced-in-text`  ·  medium · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: defect · lane: latex

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

A figure or table that no sentence points at: either it carries no \label, or its label key never appears in any \ref/\cref/\autoref. It typesets cleanly, so nothing warns; it simply floats to wherever LaTeX likes and the reader meets it with no idea why it is there. This is the inverse of a dangling reference and needs a separate check, because a set difference in one direction does not catch the other.

**Why it reads AI:** A float is produced as an artifact of the outline ('this section should have a table'), not as the answer to a sentence that needed evidence. Where a person makes a figure because a claim demanded it, the reference exists first and the float second.

**Detect:** Static: collect label keys declared inside \begin{figure|table|algorithm|listing} ... \end{} blocks; collect all keys used by \ref|\eqref|\pageref|\autoref|\cref|\Cref|\vref; flag any float label in the first set and not the second, plus any float with no \label at all. TeXtidote implements this as rule sh:figref ('Every figure should have a label, and every figure should be referenced at least once in the text').

**Fix:** Reference every float from the text before its first appearance, with \Cref or a tied \ref. If nothing in the text needs it, the float is decoration -- delete it or move it to an appendix that says so.

**False positive when:** Frontispieces, cover plates, chapter-opener art and running decorations are legitimately unreferenced, and some journal layouts carry full-page figure plates by design. An appendix of additional results under an explicit heading is also fine.

### `hand-rolled-bibliography`  ·  medium · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: shape · lane: latex

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

\begin{thebibliography} with \bibitem entries typed out by hand in a document that has or should have a .bib file. Every consequence is downstream: the entries are locked to one style forever, changing venue means retyping them, a reference cited once and then cut stays in the list, author names and journal abbreviations drift between entries, and there is no doi field to check. It is also the default shape a producer emits, because \bibitem lines need nothing outside the file while \cite needs a database that exists.

**Why it reads AI:** A .bib file is external state. Emitting a self-contained thebibliography needs only the token stream, which is the producer's whole world. The tell is not that the entries are wrong -- they may be right -- but that the document has no mechanism, so the first edit starts the drift.

**Detect:** Static: `\begin{thebibliography}` with hand-written \bibitem lines AND no `\bibliography{}` / `\addbibresource{}` anywhere. Distinguish from a .bbl inlined for arXiv submission, which is correct and usually carries a generated-by header. Then check the entries themselves: count entries carrying a DOI, and count distinct spellings of the same venue name -- 'Proc. ICSE', 'ICSE 2008', '30th International Conference on Software Engineering' in one list is the drift this creates.

**Fix:** Move the references to a .bib file, cite by key, and let BibTeX or biblatex/biber format them. Get each entry from its DOI rather than retyping it, and brace the letters that must stay capitalized (title = {A Review of {HIV} Biology}), because most styles lowercase everything else.

**False positive when:** Correct and sometimes required: a .bbl inlined for arXiv or a publisher's production pipeline; a two-page note with three references and no reuse; venues that supply a fixed thebibliography block; and amsrefs, which uses a different mechanism on purpose.

### `hyperref-load-order-violation`  ·  medium · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: code · lane: latex

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

hyperref loaded in the middle of the preamble instead of near the end, or cleveref loaded before hyperref. hyperref redefines a very large number of kernel commands, and its own documentation says to make sure it comes last of your loaded packages; cleveref's documentation says it 'must be loaded last', after hyperref. Getting this wrong produces symptoms nowhere near the cause: references that do not link, `Cref reference format for label type '' undefined`, broken bookmarks, or a page that looks correct and a PDF whose links go to the wrong target.

**Why it reads AI:** Package load order is an implicit, undocumented-in-the-source contract between packages -- it is nowhere in the file, only in each package's manual. A producer emitting a preamble in the order the packages occurred to it has no way to know, and the failure is silent or misleading rather than loud.

**Detect:** Static: extract the preamble's \usepackage order and assert hyperref comes after everything except the documented exceptions (cleveref, bookmark, glossaries, algorithm, hypcap), and cleveref after hyperref. Ten lines of script; worth a CI job on a thesis. Rendered to confirm: grep the log for `reference format for label type` and `Option clash for package hyperref`.

**Fix:** Move \usepackage{hyperref} to the end of the preamble and \usepackage{cleveref} after it. If the class already loads hyperref -- many publisher classes do -- configure it with \hypersetup{} instead of loading it again.

**False positive when:** The exceptions are real and documented per package -- hypdvips and autonum go after cleveref, bookmark goes after hyperref -- and a class that loads hyperref itself makes the question moot. Read the package docs before reordering rather than applying 'hyperref last' mechanically.

### `kitchen-sink-preamble`  ·  medium · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: shape · lane: latex

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

A preamble carrying packages nothing in the document uses, the same package loaded twice, and pairs that supersede or fight each other: subfigure with subcaption, epsfig with graphicx, times with fontspec, natbib with biblatex. A TeX.SE answer on common mistakes names it directly -- 'Carrying along enormous preambles, donated by well-meaning friends, with no idea what they're for' -- and includes a real specimen loading lmodern, mathptmx, ae, courier, mathptmx again and fontspec. The superseded half is what people notice in generated LaTeX: subfigure sits in CTAN's obsolete/ tree, and a recurring r/LaTeX observation is that chatbots reach for outdated, unsupported packages.

**Why it reads AI:** A preamble is the part of a document that is copied rather than written, so it is where training-data age accumulates fastest, and there is no cost signal on an unused \usepackage line -- it compiles, so nothing objects. The same absence of a cost signal that produces unused imports in generated code.

**Detect:** Static: three checks. (1) For each \usepackage{X}, assert at least one command that package provides appears in the document. (2) Duplicates: `grep -o 'usepackage[^{]*{[^}]*}' *.tex | sort | uniq -d`. (3) A fixed superseded map: subfigure and subfig -> subcaption; epsfig, psfig, epsf -> graphicx; doublespace -> setspace; fancyheadings -> fancyhdr; a4 and a4wide -> the a4paper class option; caption2 -> caption; scrlettr -> scrlttr2; scrpage -> scrpage2; times and mathptmx -> newtxtext/newtxmath. Rendered to confirm: `Option clash for package X` in the log is a duplicate load with conflicting options.

**Fix:** Delete every package you cannot name a use for. Resolve each superseded pair to the current package. If you inherited the preamble, comment packages out one at a time and recompile.

**False positive when:** Publisher classes require specific packages you never call directly, and a shared lab preamble serving a whole group is a reasonable engineering decision even though any one document uses a fraction of it. A large preamble is not the finding; an unused, duplicated or superseded package is.

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

\left( and \right) around every bracket in the document, including ones the height of a single character. \left...\right builds a \mathinner atom, which picks up extra spacing in many contexts, cannot be broken across lines in a display or inline, and makes the enclosed white space rigid so it will not stretch for justification. The TeXbook (pp. 148-149) names three situations where the automatic size is wrong and recommends \bigl / \bigr / \biggl / \biggr instead.

**Why it reads AI:** \left...\right is the safe default: it never produces a delimiter that is too small, and 'never too small' is the objective a producer optimizing tokens can actually reach. Choosing \bigl over \left requires knowing how tall the content renders, which is a measurement, not a token.

**Detect:** Static: `grep -c '\\left' ` against `grep -cE '\\bigl|\\Bigl|\\biggl' ` and against the total count of `(` in math. Then flag each `\left(` whose content contains no \frac, \sum, \int, \prod, matrix environment or nested sub/superscript -- those are exactly the cases where the automatic size equals the default and the only effect is the spacing penalty.

**Fix:** Plain ( ) for ordinary arguments; \bigl( ... \bigr) and friends where you want a specific size; \left...\right for genuinely tall content -- a \frac stack, a \sum with limits, a pmatrix.

**False positive when:** Contested, and honestly so. A widely used LaTeX advice guide recommends the opposite -- 'Use balanced \left and \right commands to markup bracketing elements' -- and for tall content it is right. The defensible version is '\left...\right around single-height content buys nothing and costs spacing', not 'never use it'. Treat as a craft cue, never a rule.

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

Math mode asked to do things it does not mean. Multi-letter words in italic math ($S_{easy}$ typesets as s times e times a times s times y, kerned as a product). Operator names as bare letters (sin(x) rather than \sin(x), which gets the upright font and the correct space before the argument). `*` for multiplication. $RQ_2$ used to subscript plain text. ChkTeX ships the operator list and warns 'You should perhaps use `\<op>' instead'; a TeX.SE answer on common mistakes calls the multi-letter subscript its own pet peeve.

**Why it reads AI:** In a chat window, math is rendered by KaTeX or MathJax at display sizes where the difference between italic 'easy' and upright 'easy' is hard to notice, and the token stream is identical either way. The distinction only pays off on a typeset page.

**Detect:** Static: `chktex -w35 -w29` covers operator names (warning 35, from the MathRoman list: log lg ln lim limsup liminf sin cos tan cot sec csc arcsin arccos arctan sinh cosh tanh max min sup inf arg ker dim hom det exp Pr gcd deg bmod pmod mod) and the times sign (warning 29). Independently, grep math sub/superscripts containing two or more consecutive letters: `_\{[A-Za-z]{2,}\}` and `\^\{[A-Za-z]{2,}\}`.

**Fix:** \sin, \log, \max; \DeclareMathOperator{\softmax}{softmax} for one the kernel lacks; x_{\mathrm{max}} for a descriptive subscript and \text{} (amsmath) for a subscript that is really prose; \times or \cdot for multiplication; RQ\textsubscript{2} for plain text.

**False positive when:** Single-letter subscripts (x_i, a_n) are variables and correctly italic. Multi-letter italic variable names are a real convention in economics and parts of machine learning. `*` is correct in a document about programming languages, and \mathit rather than \mathrm is right when the subscript IS a variable name.

### `missing-tie-before-ref-and-cite`  ·  medium · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: form · lane: latex

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

`Figure \ref{fig:x}` with an ordinary space, so a line break can fall between the word and its number and you get 'Figure' at the end of one line and '3' at the start of the next. The fix is a tie: `Figure~\ref{fig:x}`. Same before \cite, and after abbreviations (Dr.~Foo). ChkTeX's shipped configuration lists \ref, \vref, \pageref, \eqref and \cite as commands that should be preceded by a tilde.

**Why it reads AI:** The tie is a line-breaking instruction whose effect is invisible until a paragraph reflows at a particular width. There is no way to want it from inside the token stream, so it is omitted by default, and a producer that copies from a source that had ties will keep them inconsistently.

**Detect:** Static: `grep -nE '[A-Za-z.)] +\\(ref|eqref|pageref|vref|cite[a-z]*|autoref|[cC]ref)\{' *.tex` -- a space rather than a tie before any of them. ChkTeX warning 2 is exactly this: "Non-breaking space (`~') should have been used." `chktex -w2` is the whole check.

**Fix:** Tie before every one -- or use \Cref from cleveref, which emits the word and the tie together and removes the whole class of error.

**False positive when:** A reference starting a sentence has nothing to tie to, some classes redefine \cite to carry its own spacing, and publishers who reflow everything in production make it cosmetic. It is a real typographic finding but a small one -- never lead with it.

### `number-and-unit-run-together`  ·  medium · generic-llm · latex-source · structural · family: form · lane: latex

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

`5ms`, `10GB`, `37.2C` written with no space at all, or with an ordinary space a line break can fall into. The NIST SI style checklist requires a space between the numerical value and the unit symbol -- even when used adjectivally -- and that space should be thin and non-breaking. The same item covers thousands separators typed as commas in a document that uses a decimal point, and a hyphen used as a minus sign.

**Why it reads AI:** Units are the place where prose and typesetting meet, and the correct output needs a thin non-breaking space that has no visual analogue in a chat window. A producer writes what a reader would type in an email.

**Detect:** Static: `grep -nE '[0-9](ms|us|ns|s\b|kB|MB|GB|TB|Hz|kHz|MHz|GHz|nm|mm|cm|km|kg|mol|K\b)' *.tex` for the run-together form, and the same list preceded by a plain space for the breakable form. Exclude LaTeX length arguments first, or the pattern fires on \vspace{-0.4cm} and width=3cm: drop any hit inside the braces of \vspace|\hspace|\setlength|\addtolength or after an `=` in an optional argument. Absence of `\usepackage{siunitx}` in a document with more than a handful of measurements is the cue to look rather than the finding.

**Fix:** \usepackage{siunitx} and \qty{5}{\milli\second}, \num{123456}, \qtyrange{512}{1024}{\mebi\byte}. It gets the thin non-breaking space, the upright unit font, digit grouping and the minus sign right in one place, so a venue with a different convention becomes a one-line change.

**False positive when:** There is a genuine standards conflict on percent and degree: SI says take a space, Chicago says do not. Pick the venue's rule and be consistent. Adjectival hyphenation ('a 10-ms budget') is deliberate. And siunitx is heavy -- a document with three numbers does not need it, and `5\,ms` is perfectly good.

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

**Currency:** Fading — still seen, but vendors have patched toward it and it is weakening.

LaTeX 2.09 and plain-TeX forms that still work and still misbehave. {\bf ...} and {\it ...} reset every other font attribute, so {\it {\bf x}} is not bold italic, and there is no italic correction. $$...$$ gives wrong vertical spacing and silently disables the fleqn class option. \over is incompatible with amsmath's \frac. eqnarray spaces inconsistently and prints numbers over the formula. \centerline fights the color package and misbehaves inside lists. \def does no check that the name is free, so it overwrites silently. The canonical list is l2tabu; the nag package emits them as compile-time warnings.

**Why it reads AI:** Training data is a twenty-year archive in which 2.09 forms are everywhere, and nothing in the loop weights recency. This is the LaTeX instance of writing against the most-documented API version rather than the current one -- and it is equally common in humans who learned from an old handout.

**Detect:** Static: `grep -nE '\{\\(bf|it|rm|sc|sf|sl|tt|cal) '` plus `\$\$`, `\\over[^lp]`, `\\centerline`, `\\begin\{eqnarray\*?\}`, `\\def\\`. Better and self-maintaining: put `\usepackage[l2tabu,orthodox]{nag}` at the very top of the preamble and read the log, which names each one with its line ('Package nag Warning: Command \bf is an old LaTeX 2.09 command'). ChkTeX warning 45 covers $$...$$ and warning 41 covers primitive TeX in LaTeX code.

**Fix:** \textbf{} / \bfseries, \[...\] or equation, \frac{}{}, align from amsmath, \centering, \newcommand.

**False positive when:** \def inside package and class code is normal and correct -- the rule applies to document bodies, not to .sty and .cls files, which are a different artifact with different conventions. eqnarray in a document whose publisher class requires it is fine. And l2tabu itself dates from 2003-2007, so some of its advice has aged: its \graphicspath warning is obsolete and its inputenc advice is superseded by LaTeX's UTF-8 default.

**Automated here:** no — decidable mechanically, but this bundle does not implement it. Ask it yourself in the judge pass.

A line, table or image wider than the text block, so something pokes into the margin or off the page. LaTeX says so in the log and then typesets it anyway, which is exactly why it survives: nothing fails. Long URLs, wide tabulars, and \includegraphics at a width copied from a one-column class into a two-column one are the usual causes, and a margin violation is also how conference PDF checkers such as aclpubcheck catch a paper.

**Why it reads AI:** This is the purest case for the lane's mechanism. An overfull box exists only as a measurement made during typesetting; there is nothing in the source that says it happened. A producer that never ran the engine cannot know, and a reviewer looking at the PDF sees it in one second.

**Detect:** Rendered to confirm: `grep -c 'Overfull \\hbox' main.log`, then read the ones over about 5pt -- below that the eye cannot see it. Static prefilter: \includegraphics with `width=\textwidth` inside a two-column class, tabular rows whose cell count exceeds the column spec, and bare URLs not wrapped in \url.

**Fix:** \usepackage{url} or hyperref for URLs; tabularx, a smaller font, or \resizebox for wide tables; rewrite the sentence. Use \sloppy inside the offending paragraph only -- never in the preamble.

**False positive when:** Not a fairness question, but not every overfull box matters: a 0.5pt overfull is invisible, and many publisher classes emit a handful on their own front matter regardless of what you write. Triage by size and look at the actual page before rewriting a sentence.

**Automated here:** yes, these scripts implement it.

A tabular preamble full of `|` and an \hline between every row -- the spreadsheet look. The booktabs manual, which is the standard reference on the subject, states the rule flatly: '1. Never, ever use vertical rules. 2. Never use double rules.' booktabs' \toprule / \midrule / \bottomrule also put the right amount of space around each rule, which bare \hline does not, so superscripts collide with the line above.

**Why it reads AI:** The grid is how a table looks in a chat window, a Markdown renderer and a spreadsheet, which is where the producer's idea of a table comes from. booktabs' rule-free look is a typographic convention that only exists on a printed page.

**Detect:** Static: `grep -nE 'begin\{tabular\}\{[^}]*\|'` for vertical rules; `grep -c '\\hline'` against the row count for the full grid; `\\hline\\hline` for double rules. Second and separate finding worth the same grep pass: an \includegraphics whose filename matches /tabl|spreadsheet|screenshot/ -- a picture of a table, which is unselectable, unsearchable, wrong-fonted and inaccessible.

**Fix:** \usepackage{booktabs}; \toprule after \begin{tabular}, one \midrule under the header, \bottomrule at the end, \cmidrule(lr){2-3} to group columns, \addlinespace where you want separation rather than a rule. Right-align numbers, left-align text, and align on the decimal point with siunitx's S column.

**False positive when:** Some publishers' own styles require ruled tables and will reformat yours regardless; financial and regulatory tables often have a mandated house grid; and a genuinely two-dimensional table with spanning headers sometimes does read better with one vertical rule.

A heading built by hand from vertical space and bold text instead of \section / \subsection: `\\[12pt] \textbf{2.3 The importance of semantic mark-up} \\[10pt]`. It looks right and it is inert -- no table-of-contents entry, no \label target, no PDF bookmark, no numbering that updates, nothing for a screen reader's heading navigation. The same move appears as \begin{itemize}\item \textbf{RQ1} ... where a description environment belongs.

**Why it reads AI:** \section is semantic and its effect is decided by the class; bold-plus-space is visual and its effect is decided in the source. A producer that cannot see the class's heading style produces the appearance directly, which is the same reason generated HTML gets <div class="heading"> instead of <h2>.

**Detect:** Static: a `\textbf{` / `\large` / `\Large` / `{\bf ` construct that is (a) alone on its line, (b) adjacent to a `\\[` or `\vspace`, and (c) begins with a hand-typed section number or is title-cased. Cross-check: compare the count of \section/\subsection against the headings visible in the PDF outline; a document with eleven apparent headings and four bookmarks has seven hand-built ones.

**Fix:** Use \subsection{} and let the class number it. If the class's heading style is wrong for the venue, change it once with titlesec rather than per heading.

**False positive when:** A run-in paragraph lead (`\noindent\textbf{Ablations.}`) is a deliberate and extremely common device in space-constrained venues and is NOT a heading. Slides, posters, CVs and one-page handouts legitimately format headings by hand. The tell is a hand-NUMBERED heading with manual spacing, not bold text.

\textbf used for emphasis inside running prose, where \emph is the semantic command. \emph means 'this is emphasized' and renders as whatever the surrounding context needs -- italic in roman text, roman inside italic. \textbf means 'make this bold' and cannot adapt. It is the \section-versus-big-bold-text distinction at sentence scale.

**Why it reads AI:** Markdown has ** and no \emph, so a producer whose intuitions come from Markdown reaches for bold as the generic emphasis marker. It is a translation artifact rather than a LaTeX habit.

**Detect:** Static: prefilter by counting `\textbf{` inside body paragraphs (excluding headings, captions, table cells and description item labels) against `\emph{`. A ratio heavily favouring \textbf in prose is the cue, not the finding. Judge: for each occurrence, is this emphasis (use \emph) or a label, defined term or warning (bold is right)?

**Fix:** \emph{} for emphasis, first use of a term, and contrast. Keep \textbf for labels, run-in heads and table headers. If the document needs a third thing, define \newcommand{\finding}[1]{\textbf{#1}} so it can be changed in one place.

**False positive when:** Many venues and house styles genuinely want bold for defined terms and key results, some classes render \emph badly, and bold is correct in description labels, table headers and run-in heads. Marked low severity for exactly that reason: this is taste, and the fix is worth making either way.
