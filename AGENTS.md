# AGENTS.md

Project-specific shibboleths for proficient Port Daddy work. If you learn a new one that materially changes how to operate this repo, add it here immediately.

## Canonical Runtime

- Do not assume the live daemon is running the current checkout.
- Verify live truth with:
  - `port-daddy status`
  - `launchctl print gui/501/com.portdaddy.daemon`
  - `curl -sS "$(cat ~/.port-daddy/daemon.port 2>/dev/null | sed 's#^#http://localhost:#')/fleet"` or the daemon URL surfaced by `port-daddy status`
- `port-daddy status` proves the Unix socket path works. It does not prove the TCP/browser path works. If the control plane or FleetBar is lying, verify both the socket client and the TCP URL from the port file.
- If those disagree, trust the live process and launchd output, not docs or memory.
- There should be exactly one canonical daemon on `9876`.
- If another Port Daddy daemon is already sitting on the canonical socket/port, treat it as replaceable stale runtime, not sacred state.
- Extra daemons are only acceptable when they are explicitly opt-in on different ports/sockets/prefixes.
- Check the shell shim too: `which port-daddy` and `realpath`/symlink inspection can still point at an old checkout even after the daemon is promoted.
- A promoted canonical daemon plus a stale global CLI shim is an inconsistent operator state; relink the CLI if you intentionally move the canonical runtime to a different checkout.

## Promotion

- The real promotion path is `./scripts/promote-stable.sh`.
- Do not hand-roll daemon promotion with ad hoc `launchctl` commands if the script exists.
- If the user asks to "promote the daemon", run the script first and report the exact blocker if it fails.
- If promotion is blocked by dirty archaeology, split green feature/parity slices from intentionally red bug-battery tests; do not bundle known-red test files into an otherwise promotable commit.
- The script expects:
  - current branch is `main`
  - no uncommitted source changes in `lib/`, `server.ts`, `mcp/`, `routes/`, `bin/`, or `tests/`

## Fleet Identity

- Logical fleet names are not unique enough. `port-daddy-dev` can exist in more than one checkout.
- Use `projectDir` as the durable identity in UI state, routing, and daemon/API lookups.
- Only use logical project name as a display label.
- Fleet trigger channels are project-scoped by default.
- The current fleet engine already scopes trigger and publish channels through `lib/fleet-channels.ts`. If cross-project wakeups still happen, suspect leaked legacy `port-daddy-cli watch git:committed ...` processes before assuming the current engine lacks scoping.
- Do not treat any hook containing `git:committed` as "already correct". Legacy Port Daddy hooks published naked `git:committed`; installers must detect and replace those in place.
- Keep YAML logical channels human-readable like `git:committed`, but publish/subscribe on a physical scoped channel derived from `projectDir`.
- Reserve `global:<channel>` for intentional cross-project fanout. Cross-project wakeups are a bug unless explicitly marked global.

## Control Plane

- `fleet-config-ui` is the real control plane surface.
- `public/fleet-ui` is the built artifact served by the daemon.
- FleetBar should open the real control plane, not a shadow dashboard with reduced functionality.
- FleetBar is the top-level navigator when embedded. The embedded control plane must receive `?embed=fleetbar` and hide duplicate in-app surface tabs.
- FleetBar embed detection should not rely on query params alone. The WebView must identify itself too, so a dropped query string does not resurrect duplicate chrome.
- Only `Flow` keeps the persistent project rail. `Activity`, `Channels`, `Inbox`, `Sorties`, and `YAML` should use the full page width.
- Project changes must preserve the current surface. Selecting a different project should not silently dump the user back to Flow.
- Do not claim an embedded surface is fixed from a loading-state screenshot. Wait for a settled render and verify the actual surface content is visible.
- Session notes and handoffs carry explicit `agentId` and `identityProject`; use those fields for attribution before falling back to text matching.
- Project-scoped Activity filtering must include `story.agentId`; if you only filter note text and `identityProject`, valid handoffs will disappear from the timeline.
- Session lifecycle activity is also structured data. `session.start`, `session.end`, `session.note`, `file.claim`, `file.release`, and sugar begin/done events should stamp `agentId`, `targetId`, and `identityProject` so briefing/FleetBar/UI do not have to reverse-engineer scope from prose.

## Operator UX Expectations

- Top-level tabs must behave like top-level pages. Do not hide a selected tab's main content inside a collapsed lower panel.
- Agent detail should default to non-empty, high-signal activity:
  - recent meaningful messages
  - mutations / touched files
  - handoffs / artifacts
- Filter low-signal system noise instead of surfacing empty or trivial channel traffic.
- FleetBar popover is not just a launcher. It should surface recent per-agent summaries, last-active hints, and touched files that can be opened directly.

## Current Gotchas

- If multiple Port Daddy checkouts exist, duplicate fleet names can make project selection and routing look broken unless everything keys by `projectDir`.
- Before concluding a UI fix "didn't work", verify the daemon being queried is the one serving this checkout's `public/fleet-ui`.
- `docs/recovery/CURRENT-WORK.md` is the canonical in-flight queue. Update it as the active thread changes; then reflect larger closures in `.cartographer/status.md`.
- Do not hardcode `9876` as if it is guaranteed truth. `9876` is the preferred canonical port, but runtime code must discover the live daemon via the shared socket/port-file helper because the daemon can fall back.
- Do not hardcode `localhost` as if it is harmless truth either. TCP callers should go through the shared loopback host helper instead of sprinkling new `http://localhost:9876` literals around the repo.
- If a runtime/helper/UI path needs the daemon URL, prefer the shared discovery helper over inline `http://localhost:9876` defaults.
- `pd init` and any hook installer should copy the shared project-scoped post-commit template instead of writing bespoke inline hook logic that can drift.
- If a fleet project drops into `skipped` with `owner: null` and `fleet lease lost: lock not held`, treat that as a recoverability bug. The daemon should reacquire the lease when nobody else owns it, not sit idle forever.
